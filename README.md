# StockWise: Stock Price Prediction Mobile App 

In today's fast-paced financial markets, investors and traders are constantly seeking tools and resources to make informed decisions. The "StockWise" project aims to address this need by developing a cutting-edge mobile application that provides stock price predictions and comprehensive financial insights. This introduction outlines my plan to create a robust and user-friendly stock prediction app.<br/><br/>

The project is primarily in the domain of finance, data analytics, and software development because my objective is to create a mobile app that people can use to help them with their decision-making in investments. We have features such as portfolio management, a stock screener, and showing historical stock prices with predictions and data analysis consisting of data visualizations. I also used machine learning to predict future stock prices, which is information that users can consider in their investment decisions. <br/><br/>

Lastly, The News Fragment is the feature of the app that provides users with a sentiment analysis of financial news. The models for sentiment analysis were developed using TensorFlow and Keras in Python. These Python models are then loaded through Python scripts and these scripts are being called by Java code with the help of Chaquopy.<br/><br/>
