# StockWise
This is a group project for our Applied Research Project class. Our plan is to develop a mobile app using Java, Python, and Chaquopy. The app will be used for portfolio management of stocks, to view historical data of stocks, as well as to predict the potential future prices of stocks based on news articles.
